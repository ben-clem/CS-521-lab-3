<h1 align="center">Lab 3: Code Cracking</h1>

## Game plan

I followed the lab template and instructions.

## Comments

I was surprised that it wasn't more difficult to switch to an NxN-sized version. I had read the entire instructions ahead of time, so that must have helped me anticipate the general solution when I was doing the 3x3. The real challenge was keeping the same graphic style for varying board sizes.
